# ETL
An ETL (extract, transform, load) project using bash. This is the final project for a Linux class. 

The requirements for this project are listed below:

  1. copy a file from a remote location using scp
  2. unzip the file
  3. remove the header
  4. convert all text to lowercase
  5. update values in 'gender' column
  6. remove (and add to a seperate file) records which did not have valid values for the 'state' column
  7. remove the "$" from the 'purchase_amt' column
  8. sort the file
  9. generate two reports (summary.rpt and purchase.rpt)


This was a really interesing and fun project that challenged, and reinforced, my knowledge of bash and awk.
